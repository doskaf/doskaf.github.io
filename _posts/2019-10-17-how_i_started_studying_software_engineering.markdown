     Before I decided to persue a career in the tech field, I was going to school for business. After some time, I began to feel like that path just wasn't for me. My heart wasn't in it and I *definitely* couldn't see myself doing it for a living. I felt so lost trying to figure out another career that was not only achievable, but also something that I could excel in and really have a passion for. That is-- until someone told me about software engineering courses. For the first time, I felt like I had a plan. I finally felt like this was something I could do. So, I did my research and I ended up finding Flatiron! I thought that it would be the best program for me because it seemed like a challenge, but nothing impossible. It seemed like a real, tangible goal that I could achieve and learn so much from. So, here I am! Ready and excited to learn!
