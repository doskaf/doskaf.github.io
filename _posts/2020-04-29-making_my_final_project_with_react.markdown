For my final project, I decided to build a mock Airbnb application. Going into it, I was very nervous because React and Redux were both so new to me. I struggled a lot trying to understand how they work while going through the lessons, but as I worked on my project things started clicking more and more for me. I'm still not 100% confident in using them, but I'm much more so than I was just a week ago. This project was a huge learning experience and an emotional rollercoaster but I feel more secure in my coding skills after building it. If I could improve on it, I would implement a user model. Currently, anyone can add or delete any listing or booking so adding a user model would ensure that only the owner of a listing can delete it, etc. I would also implement some sort of visual calendar to show which days a listing already has bookings for while creating a new booking. I would also allow for images of a listing to be submitted and displayed when creating a listing. Over all though, I'm proud of myself for getting through this project. It was my first time really trying to use bootstrap effectively. My styling turned out to be simple but visually appealing, which was my goal! In conclusion, I'm glad that I had this experience to test my skills. I'm excited to work on my craft and use these skills for future projects.
