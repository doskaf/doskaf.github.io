My experience with this project was an emotional rollercoaster. I was actually supposed to finish it about a month ago with my previous cohort, but because I took so long doing the Sinatra project, I was behind on studying the Rails section. Because of this, I was sort of just rushing through all the material and I wasn't fully absorbing everything. Of course, this lead to a lot of panicking when it came down to project week. I felt so lost and discouraged because I felt like I wasn't prepared at all. It was very difficult, but I made the decision to move to the next cohort so I could repeat the Rails section. At first, I was so dissappointed in myself. I knew I could've done better. But as time went on and as I went through the lessons that I had gone through before, I realized that I was learning more than ever! When it came to redoing my Rails project, I felt so much more confident and comfortable in my knowledge. This time around, I had a much better plan of what I wanted my site to be, and when things got tough, I didn't panic! I'm so proud of myself and how far I've come in so little time.

I thought repeating the module was a major setback, but it's actually helped me immensely. I learned how to absorb information better and how to keep my cool when I don't understand something. I'm proud to say that I've overcome something that made me feel terrible about myself for about a good month of my life. Now I feel like I can conquer the world! Hopefully I'll be able to take my new and improved habits into this next section!
