My Sinatra project is a very simple web application where you can sign in as a user and create your own penguins, as well as edit and delete them. To be honest, I'm not happy at all with the way this turned out. All the basic structures and features are there, but I imagined it to be much more grand with css styling and even a visual representation of your penguin. Time got the best of me though, so I had to settle for what I have now. Even if I'm disappointed with how it turned out, I still learned so much from this project. Now, when I look at websites such as Twitter and Facebook, I can begin to understand how they might've been constructed.
