Making this project was a bit of a journey. At first, I didn't know whether to do something difficult and impressive, or simple and easy for this project. I eventually settled on the latter for fear of not finishing on time. I tried to go for something practical. To me, an app where you could post recipes and have a shopping list made for you from those recipes' ingredients was both practical and took care of the has-many relationship that was required. While I was building the app, I was relying on selecting a specific child of certain elements to carry out my functionalities. I now know that this was bad practice and I should have been assigning those elements their own ids, but by the time I realized that I should have changed things, I was already in too deep. As expected, when I tried to change things up it was difficult because "element.children[3]" might have changed while I was switching things around. I'll try not to do this for future projects. On the bright side, I learned a ton about Javascript while creating this project and I actually really enjoyed working with it! I'm becoming a much better problem-solver and a much better programmer! I'm looking forward to learning even more while creating the next project.
